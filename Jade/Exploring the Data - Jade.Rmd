 We do not have enough data to do Dublin's performance elsewhere in my opinion.

With the dub dataset, there are a set of 4 matches in 2011 that says Venue = Dublin. Wikipedia shows that these matches took place in Croke Park. So I want to edit the intial gaa dataset to change these variables to Croke Park so that we can include them.

Let's say I want to now create a variable that gives the number of wins.
For Croke Park. We want to focus on performance, so whether they win or lose, and how many points they score.
```{r}

Plot that highlights the number of wins and losses for each of the 4 teams in Croke Park. It clearly shows that Dublin has a much higher number of wins compared to the others, but also that is has played many more times in Croke Park.
