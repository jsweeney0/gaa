INTRODUCTION

Our data is the gaa dataset. It contains 1944 observations of Gaelic Athletic Association matches from 2001 to 2017. This includes the teams that played, the division, the venue, the date and the scores. 
An infamous claim is that Dublin always plays better in Croke Park, one of the major stadiums in the GAA. It's location gives Dublin a home advantage, however we would like to check if this is true. Does the venue have any impact on Dublin's play or does Croke Park have no impact on the skill of the team? Our proposed research question is 'What is the impact of Croke Park on Dublin's match performance in division 1 games and how does this compare to other top counties' performance in the same venue'.
