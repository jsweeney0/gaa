Group Meeting 1 29/3/22
- Today we initially had a look at the dataset as a group and began to brainstorm potential research questions. We wanted to find a question that could be very interesting to visualise and that we would be able to reach a clear and valuable conclusion.
- We ended up being split between two potential questions, both very similar.

"What is the impact of Croke Park on Dublin's match performance in division 1?" which would be followed by:
  1. "and how does this compare to other counties' performances in Croke Park?"
  2. "and how does it compare to Dublin's match performance in different venues?"

- We want to know whether Dublin has an advantage playing in Croke Park, and we can do this in two different ways as highlighted by our questions.

- We began to set up Github so that we can share our code with one another outside of our meetings.
- We also began to analyse the code, filtering to get the dataset relevant to our research question.

- We plan to meet again on Friday 1/4/22 for our next meeting
